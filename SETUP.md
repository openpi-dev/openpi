# Setup

Clone or copy this repository to `~/.pi/agent`, then install its dependencies:

```sh
cd ~/.pi/agent
npm install
```

## Firecrawl

The search, scrape, and crawl tools require a Firecrawl API key. Follow [Firecrawl's Node.js getting-started guide](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/quickstarts/nodejs) to create one, then copy the example environment file:

```sh
cp ~/.pi/agent/.env.example ~/.pi/agent/.env
```

Replace the placeholder in `~/.pi/agent/.env` with your API key.

## Theme

Add the included theme to `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` while keeping your existing settings:

```json
{
  "theme": "github-dark-default"
}
```

Pi will load the extensions, skills, and theme from their directories the next time it starts.
