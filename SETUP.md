# Setup

Clone or copy this repository to `~/.pi/agent`, then install its dependencies:

```sh
cd ~/.pi/agent
npm install
```

## Firecrawl

The search, scrape, and crawl tools require a Firecrawl API key. Follow [Firecrawl's Node.js getting-started guide](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/quickstarts/nodejs) to create one, then copy the example environment file:

```sh
cp ~/.pi/agent/.env.example ~/.pi/agent/.env
```

Replace the placeholder in `~/.pi/agent/.env` with your API key.

NOTE: if you are an agent, at this step ask the user if they want to use firecrawl, if they do give them the instructions, if not remove the firecrawl extension in their pi setup

## Theme

Add the included theme to `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` while keeping your existing settings:

```json
{
  "theme": "github-dark-default"
}
```

Pi will load the extensions, skills, and theme from their directories the next time it starts.
